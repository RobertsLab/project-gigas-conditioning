# For monday: percent decrease in growth with priming 
# primed -treated over (primed*100)
# percent decrease in growth with priming (percentage) 
# ask Chas if we can keep stuff out there (touch base March, measure April) 
# compare goose point and westcott data
# think about how I want this to fit in the dissertation
# experimental design google doc, what I would want to sample for, when I would want to sample, etc.
