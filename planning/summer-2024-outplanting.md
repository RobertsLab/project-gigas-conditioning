### Overview of hardening efforts and stocks 

![](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-gigas-conditioning/blob/main/overview.png?raw=true)

We are going to outplant oysters at with commercial partners from efforts B, D, and E.  

## Effort B: 2023 POGS seed daily hardening

| Treatment           | Number of Animals | Approx. Size | Current location | Identifiers                                                              | Number Bags | Animals per bag | Outplant location | Notes                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Temperature treated | 250               | 10-25 mm     | Point Whitney    | "POGS daily seed; silos; right tank" &amp; "POGS seed bags   #3 and #4"  | 5           | 50             | Westcott          | Size >12 mm |
| Control             | 250               | 10-25 mm     | Point Whitney    | "POGS daily seed; silos; middle tank" &amp; "POGS seed   bags #1 and #2" | 5           | 50             | Westcott          | Size >12 mm |

Animals too small (<12 mm or close to 12 mm in length and/or width) kept in original bags at Point Whitney. These can be used for survivorship curve testing or sampling.  

## Effort D: 2023 POGS small seed weekly hardening

| Treatment           | Number of Animals | Approx. Size | Current location | Identifiers    | Number Bags | Animals per bag | Outplant location | Notes                                  |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Temperature treated (Tray 1) | 600               | 15-30mm      | Point Whitney    | Outdoor trays  | 6           | 100             | Westcott          |  |
| Control (Tray 2)             | 600               | 15-30mm      | Point Whitney    | Outdoor trays  | 6           | 100             | Westcott          |  |
| Temperature treated (Tray 3) | 500               | 15-30mm      | Point Whitney    | Outdoor trays  | 5           | 100             | Westcott       |      |
| Control (Tray 4)             | 500               | 15-30mm      | Point Whitney    | Outdoor trays  | 5           | 100             | Westcott       |      |

Animals left over (small size or extras) kept in original trays at Point Whitney. These can be used for survivorship curve testing or sampling. 

## Effort E: 2023 POGS large seed weekly hardening

| Treatment                  | Number of Animals | Approx. Size | Current location | Identifiers                  | Number Bags | Animals per bag | Outplant location | Notes                                  |

# Next steps

1. Perform lab survivorship testing from Efforts B, D, and E with leftover/small samples 
2. Take samples for RNA/DNA/frozen for any assays we might want to run on these groups for mechanistic work
